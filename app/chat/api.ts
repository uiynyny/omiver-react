Split the model responses into 3 potential responses based on nutritional groups of the entered metabolites (carbohydrates/sugar, proteins, and lipids/fats)

EG: If I say I have low leucine, the model should mention something about increasing leucine levels by eating X, Y, or Z foods to compensate. 

Your Output Example:

Intro:
Based on your information, I would suggest the following dietary recommendations to help you achieve your exercise goal of [X] while addressing the [recite metabolomic information the user entered, ie high valine and leucine, etc] in your blood:

Responses based on different nutritional groups. WIll correspond with whatever metabolites were mentioned, as well as with whatever their exercise goal is:
Protein response:
Example: Increase protein intake: Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) that are important for muscle growth and repair. As you already have higher-than-expected levels of leucine and valine, it's essential to consume enough protein to meet your body's needs without further increasing BCAA levels. Aim for a daily protein intake of 1.6-2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight, depending on your activity level and goals.
Carbohydrate/Sugar Response:
Lipid/Fat Response:

Diet Recommendation:
Food Recommendations: Recommend a few foods that they could eat in higher or lower quantities to achieve the recommendations from the top section.
Example: While it's crucial to consume enough protein, it's also important to choose high-quality protein sources that are rich in other essential amino acids to avoid overloading your body with BCAA. Good sources of protein include chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, and tofu. 
Example: Increase complex carbohydrate intake: To support your bulking goals, you should also increase your intake of complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. These foods provide the energy you need for your workouts and help you maintain a healthy weight.

Dish Recommendations: Suggest a few dishes that can be made which incorporate the above advice
